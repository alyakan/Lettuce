# Lettuce
Simple network interceptor for Swift

## CocoaPods
You want to add pod `'Lettuce', '~> 0.0.2'` similar to the following to your Podfile:
```ruby
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'Lettuce', '~> 0.0.2'
end
```
Then run a pod install inside your terminal, or from CocoaPods.app.

Alternatively to give it a test run, run the command:

`pod try Lettuce`
